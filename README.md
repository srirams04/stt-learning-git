### Overview:
Version-control software like Git is essential in the modern-day workflow of major projects as they enable better tracking of code changes and deployment versions.  

They also enable seamless collaboration between hundreds of programmers by establishing some fixed actions/processes like staging, committing, pushing to the remote repository, creating pull requests, merging by resolving conflicts and so on. 

 

### Objective
